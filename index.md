## Module: Collections and Remixes

### Why it Matters
> This module provides context about collections and remixes for faculty OER developers of Rhetoric, Composition, and Speech Communication content. The distinction between collections and remixes is especially important for new OER projects that are primarily based on existing OER, as developers must take into account license compatibility and future uses of the new content being developed. 

### Learning Outcomes
In this module, you will:
- **Define** collections 
- **Define** remixes.
- **Differentiate** collections and remixes
- **Apply** compatible licenses to new OER projects

## 1. Collections   
In general, for your OER work a **collection** is analogous to an **anthology**. If your project combines unmodified texts, media, or other content in single location with only basic non-adaptive format changes, it is considered a collection. For example, if you are developing a Literature OER, you might create an anthology of several different short stories, poems, and essays. These individual texts keep their original licenses 

Take a look at [this collection](collection.md) of student designed infographics about digital media.
