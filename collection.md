# Collection: Digital Media Infographics

## Introduction
This collection represents sample student work between 2018 and 2019. Students in a junior-level digital composition class were required to create infographics connecting their area of research interest to digital media studies. Students used a variety of platforms to create these infographics, and part of the assignment was to choose a license for the final product. Most students chose one of the Creative Commons licenses discussed in class, but others did choose to maintain their "All Rights Reserved" copyright. The assignment description, below, describes how students went about choosing and justifying their licenses. Spend some time reading the assignment description, and decide for yourself how well the infographics in the collection followed the guidelines.
