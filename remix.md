# Remix: Public Speaking and Audience Analysis

Any act of communication must take into account audience, whether it's an essay, a speech, or a mobile app. Audience analysis is arguably the most important part of the communication process: if your audience can't process the information you're trying to share, ultimately you have failed in your rhetorical mission. Think about these three scenarios:

1. **Essay**: You're writing an essay about the geological processes of a volcano and your audience consists primarily of high school students. What do they already know? What needs explanation? What information is useful to them? If you write the essay in a way that only Ph.D students in Geological Sciences can understand, you've failed to reach your audience.

2. **Speech**: You're giving a speech about the environmental dangers of pesticides to a group of farmers. What is their exisitng opinion on pesticdes? What is their background knowledge? How should you approach the topic if they are skeptical or, worse, hostile? If your speech is belittling or paternalistic, or cities tons of examples that the farmers will not relate to, you've failed to reach your audience.

3. **Mobile App**: You're creating a new mobile app for sharing recipes primarily for senior citizens. How do older people use apps? What technical considerations are required for this kind of app? If your app is overly complicated or uses small text, low-contrast colors, or highly technical language, senior citizens might not be interested in trying it, and you will have failed to reach your audience (or, more accurately, your users). 

One of the advantages of studying public speaking and improving your own skills is that you become much more aware of what other speakers do. In one respect, we are able to look for ways to emulate what they do—for example, how they might seamlessly incorporate stories or examples into their speaking, or how they might use transitions to help audiences follow the speech’s logic. In another respect, we become aware of how a speaker might use dramatic delivery or emotional appeals to hide a lack of facts or logic. 

Communication always involves a content dimension and a relationship dimension. Nowhere does that become more important than when we look into what is commonly known as audience analysis.  You are not using the speech to dump a large amount of content on the audience; you are making that con-tent important, meaningful, and applicable to them. Additionally, the way the audience perceives you and your connection to them—such as whether there is mutual trust and respect—will largely determine your success with the audience. The speaker must respect the audience as well as the audi-ence trusting the speaker

**Audience analysis** is the process of gathering information about the people in your audience so that you can understand their needs, expectations, beliefs, values, attitudes, and likely opinions. There are three different types of audience analysis and several techniques to use in conducting audience analysis. Take a look at this video about audience analysis and start thinking more about how think about audience every day:
